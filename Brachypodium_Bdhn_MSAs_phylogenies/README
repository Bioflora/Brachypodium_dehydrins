This folder contains matrix alignment for:
  a) each Bdhn gene from B. distachyon, B.stacei, B. sylvaticum and B. hybridum (subgenome D and subgenome S) plus DHN orthologous gene sequences from five outgroups
     (A. tauschii, H. vulgare, O. sativa, S. bicolor and Z. mays).
  b) An alignment of the 47 Bdhn genes found within the four Brachypodium and 47 DHNs from the outgroups.

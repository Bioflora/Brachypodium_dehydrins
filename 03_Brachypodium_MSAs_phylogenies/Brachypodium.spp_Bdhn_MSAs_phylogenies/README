This folder contains matrix alignment for:
  1) each Bdhn gene from B. distachyon, B.stacei, B. sylvaticum and B. hybridum (subgenome D and subgenome S) plus DHN orthologous gene sequences from five outgroups
     (A. tauschii, H. vulgare, O. sativa, S. bicolor and Z. mays).
  2) An alignment of the 47 Bdhn genes found within the four Brachypodium and 35 DHNs from the outgroups.
  3) A folder that contains the annotation file for each Bdhn gene MSA

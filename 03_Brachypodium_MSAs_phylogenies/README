This folder contains:
  - Brachypodium.spp_Bdhn_MSAs_phylogenies: a folder containing 9 alignments (Exon+intron) of each Bdhn gene for the four Brachypodium species
    studied plus 5 outgropus species, used to describe Bdhns in Brachypodium and the phylogenetic analysis. Additionally, contains a folder with 
    anotation files.
    
  - B.distachyon_MSAs: a folder containing alignments (Exon+Intron) of Bdhn genes within 54 B. distachyon ecotypes, used in phylogentic and expression analysis. 
    Additionally, contains a folder with anotation files.
    - 10  MSAs correponding to each Bdhn in 54 B.distachyon lines plus B.stacei Bdhn homologous gene.
    - B.distachyon_Bdhns_concatenated_MSA.fna: An aligment of 10 Bdhns of 54 B.distachyon ecotypes and 9 B. stacei Bdhns
    - Bdistachyon_Bdhn_Phylogeneticsignal_concatenated_MSA.fna: An aligment of Bdhn genes with phylogentic signal concatenated and Bstacei homologous genes.
